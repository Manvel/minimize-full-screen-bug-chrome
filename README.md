# MacOs fullscreen minimized window issue
Opening new minimized window in MacOs on full-screen mode causes the minimized
window to be opened in the foreground and stealing the focus.

## Reproduction steps
1. Install current extension into the Chrome browser on MacOs.
2. Open window with running extension in full screen mode(Command + Control + F).
3. Click on the extension icon.
4. Observe.


### Observed behavior
The minimized window is opened in the foreground, stealing the focus and makes
the UI unusable(as there is no exit full-screen button anymore).

### Expected behavior
The minimized window should be opened in the background and not steal the focus.

## Additional information
Tested on:
- Chrome version: 113.0.5672.92 (Official Build) (x86_64)
- MacOs version: Ventura 13.3.1
